# AllTrails (React + Vite)

A starter web front-end for the AllTrails concept.

## Quick start
```bash
pnpm i      # or npm install / yarn
pnpm dev    # vite dev server
pnpm build  # production bundle

## To run on browser: npm install -> npm run dev
## To run server: node server.cjs

This app was created with the already existing AllTrails app. It allows users to connect with other hikers based on geolocation, interests, etc. It is a social expansion with the pre-exisitng functionality of AllTrails (find trails, rate trails, etc.)

FOR EASY SETUP IN SSMS;
- I included db.bacpac which is what I did in SSMS
- Copy it locally and you can use SSMS Import Wizard to open it on your computer
